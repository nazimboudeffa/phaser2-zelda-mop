  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Welcome to this serie of tutorials about Phaser CE</p>
  <p>
    The original game is on http://solarus-games.org
    and, this project is just a normal continuation in js

    but the licence MUST be respected and i don't know how to do ?
    perhaps by just saying it's a game i have bought but it's the property of NINTENDO (it's weired)
    or the assets are the property of nintendo but i have writed the code, because i love this world of Zelda

    so the logo is the same copy as for mystery of solarus with a pixel art of Luke light saber
  </p>
  <p>
    (
    in fact Christopho has banned me from his twitter for no reason but i credit his work
    because i don't have any thing special to say about it just to credit his work on zelda
    the question still is what if nobody speak with you on your work ? and when they help you in it you ban them
    )
    (
    it's not the first time i see something like this because i had the bad experience in meshtogether slack
    and gits first assault discord and again for no valuable reason i have been banned
    )
    (while i was practically banned too from phaserjs because i have been considered as a person that shares links
    i'v started to don't help anymore)
    (today i have been unbanned from mesh to the new slack and i am still banned from Ghost in the shell)
